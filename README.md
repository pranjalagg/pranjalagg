```javascript
always:
	try{
		your best and;
		do{
			what you need to do;
		} while (you still have time);

		for (opportunity; comes; only once){
			so grab the chance;
		}

		if (you fail)
			throw "all your worries";
	} catch (yourself){
		everytime you fail;
		and you know to whom
		you should goto always;
